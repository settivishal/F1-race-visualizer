/**
 * `fetchSessionByKey` exists because of a bug worth not repeating.
 *
 * Resolving a session used to mean fetching whole seasons from a hardcoded
 * list of years — `[2025, 2024, 2023]` — and filtering for the key. It worked
 * until the calendar moved past the list, and then every import of a 2026 race
 * failed with "session not found" while the API had the data all along. The
 * cron would have hit the same wall in March and reported nothing wrong.
 *
 * So the one thing to pin is that the key reaches the query string, and that
 * a year is not part of the lookup.
